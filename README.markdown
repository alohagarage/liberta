Liberta
=======

### Overview

Liberta is a simple word-game application based on some of the ideas of the 
ideas of the Italian Futurists. It is meant to be fun to play and to stimulate
the use and learning of complex grammatical structures.

The name "Liberta" is a reference to F.T. Marinetti's technique of *parole en liberta*,
or "Free Words." This technique is reminiscent of the Surrealist technique of
automatism, or free-association. What Marinetti brought of novelty, was his
introduction of typography as another channel of communication.
