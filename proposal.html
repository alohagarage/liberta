    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <h3>Background on Futurism</h3>
    <p>Futurism's formal beginning was in 1909, heralded by the publication of 
    the <em>Futurist Manifesto</em> in the French newspaper <em>Le Figaro</em>. 
    The Manifesto proclaimed a firm opposition to all that was old, traditional 
    and staid about Italian art and society. In no particular order, they promised to 
    <ol>
      <li>We want to sing the love of danger, the habit of energy and rashness.
      </li>
      <li>The essential elements of our poetry will be courage, audacity and revolt.
      </li>
      <li>Literature has up to now magnified pensive immobility, ecstasy and 
      slumber. We want to exalt movements of aggression, feverish sleeplessness, 
      the double march, the perilous leap, the slap and the blow with the fist.
      </li>
      <li>We declare that the splendor of the world has been enriched by a new 
      beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing automobile with its bonnet adorned 
      with great tubes like serpents with explosive breath ... a roaring motor 
      car which seems to run on machine-gun fire, is more beautiful than the 
      Victory of Samothrace.
      </li>
      <li>We want to sing the man at the wheel, the ideal axis of which crosses 
      the earth, itself hurled along its orbit.
      </li>
      <li>The poet must spend himself with warmth, glamour and prodigality to 
      increase the enthusiastic fervor of the primordial elements.
      </li>
      <li>Beauty exists only in struggle. There is no masterpiece that has not 
      an aggressive character. Poetry must be a violent assault on the forces 
      of the unknown, to force them to bow before man.
      </li>
      <li>We are on the extreme promontory of the centuries! What is the use of 
      looking behind at the moment when we must open the mysterious shutters 
      of the impossible? Time and Space died yesterday. We are already living 
      in the absolute, since we have already created eternal, omnipresent speed.
      </li>
      <li>We want to glorify war — the only cure for the world — militarism, 
      patriotism, the destructive gesture of the anarchists, the beautiful 
      ideas which kill, and contempt for woman.
      </li>
      <li>We want to demolish museums and libraries, fight morality, feminism 
      and all opportunist and utilitarian cowardice.
      </li>
      <li>We will sing of the great crowds agitated by work, pleasure and 
      revolt; the multi-colored and polyphonic surf of revolutions in modern 
      capitals: the nocturnal vibration of the arsenals and the workshops 
      beneath their violent electric moons: the gluttonous railway stations 
      devouring smoking serpents; factories suspended from the clouds by the 
      thread of their smoke; bridges with the leap of gymnasts flung across 
      the diabolic cutlery of sunny rivers: adventurous steamers sniffing the 
      horizon; great-breasted locomotives, puffing on the rails like enormous 
      steel horses with long tubes for bridle, and the gliding flight of 
      aeroplanes whose propeller sounds like the flapping of a flag and the 
      applause of enthusiastic crowds.
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    What was remarkable for the time, though, 
    was the vehemence with which this proclamation was made. While many an artistic 
    movement had made heady claims about the power of art and the desire for a 
    utopian future, many of the movements had done so under the aegis of Romanticism 
    or <em>L'art pour l'art</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
    And while the conjunction of avant-garde art and pedagogy may seem as likely 
    a meeting as, say, an umbrella and a sewing machine on an operating table, 
    I think that a strong case can be made for the essentially educational aims 
    of the Futurists. In Marinetti's writings, the Italian makes reference to what 
    he calls a "Total Revolution" in Italy. By this, he means not only a superficial 
    political revolution, but a revolution that would also remake the souls of 
    Italian people and help them prepare for a different future. We can see that 
    the aim of Futurism was never solely to entertain people, but to get them to 
    think differently. And isn't this, ultimately, the goal of education as well?
    </p>
    <h3>Overview of Futurist Poetics </h3>
    Although Futurism was a complex movement with several variants, we can 
    isolate three main features of their poetics that are promising for the teaching 
    of complex grammatical competencies.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Play</strong>
          <p>
          While subsequent avant-garde movements, such as <a href="#" class="citation" 
          data-note="1" data-freebase="dada">Dada</a> from Switzerland and the more well-known French 
          <a href="#" class="citation" data-note="2" data-freebase="surrealism">Surrealism</a> are more 
          commonly identified as "playful" &#8212Most likely because of the 
          Futurists' warlike tone&#8212 the Futurists also held play and the 
          ludic in high esteem. One need only reference their famous <em>Soiree 
          Futuriste</em> with their wild antics and biting satire.
          </p>
          <p>
          Perhaps more importantly than play as such, the Futurists were attracted 
          to one of play's constituent elements: chance.
          </p>
          <p>
          Conflict
          </p>
          <p>
          While the importance of play, chance and risk in art may now seem obvious, 
          what may not have seemed obvious at the time was the pedagogical value 
          of chance. But there are have been <a href="#" class="citation" data-freebase="futurism" data-note="3">several</a> studies on 
          importance of play and chance in pedagogy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Technology</strong>
        <p>Thematically, technology was extremely important for the Futurists. 
        A cursory glance at their work, in both writing and painting, will note 
        the prevalence of trains, automobiles, factories and airplanes. And while 
        the idea of someone singing an ode to the automobile now seems either 
        banal or quaint, at the beginning of the 20th century, it was unheard of. 
        On the rare occasion that any artifact of modern technology made it into a poem, 
        it served as a foil; it was used to disparage the modern world.
        </p>
        <p>
        But technology was not just a theme for the Futurists. I would argue that 
        technology was actually the impetus for the movement as a whole. It was 
        technology that set in motion the massive societal shifts that Futurism 
        was responding to: mass migration, new forms of warfare, speed of industrial 
        change. And it was this fervent new world that the Futurists hoped to prepare 
        the Italian people for. What was radically different about the Futurists'
        stance on technology was their opinion that it was a force: neither good 
        nor bad, it was a force that could be harnessed by the will of a person or 
        a nation.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Futurists weren't only impelled by technology, they employed it to 
        express themselves. In the field of literature, Marinetti and his cohort 
        strained at the limits of typographic technology. The Futurist architect 
        <a href="#" class="citation">Alberto Sant'Elia</a> imagined structures and possibilities for cities that are only now 
        being realized. <a href="#" class="citation">P. Russolo</a> started the 
        development of the synthesizer with his <em>Intonarumori</em> instruments 
        and predicted the rise of new forms of atonal and electronic music in his treatise 
        <a href="http://www.google.com">The Art of Noises</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Futurists used technology to prepare society for a more technological 
        future. We find ourselves in a similar position with Liberta. What is shocking 
        is that, in the period between the Futurists and ourselves, there has been 
        very little in the way of investigation on the proper role and use of 
        technology for learning. Technology, too often, is either explicitly or 
        implicitly treated as a fad in learning. Prevalence here is a poor 
        substitute for understanding.
